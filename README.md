## Social Events - React Application

In this project I created an Events application with React, similiar to *'Meetup'*.<br>
I put emphasize on **UI & UX**, making it look great and make the user experience as fluent as possible.<br>
I took advantage of *Firebase and it's Firestore Database*, which integrates well with React and offers to us 'live-data', to display real- time changes as the user integrates with our application.

### Key Functions

* The user can register or login with social network like Facebook/Google.
* The user has a profile with details about himself, and the events he is hosting/attends/attended.
* The profile includes option to upload images to the user's album.
* The user can create events, specifiyng the location, category, date, etc.
* Each event has it's Event Details page, with all it's details and the location on the map using Google Maps API (I will add functionality to display the nearest events, sorted by the interests of the user).
* Chat will be added soon.
* Recent Activity will be added soon.
* The site will be uploaded when development will end.
